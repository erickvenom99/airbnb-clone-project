# Overview of Airbnb Clone

##  Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide robust and scalable functionality that manages user interactions, search and discovery with advanced search filters (location, price, amenities, date, etc.), property listings, bookings, and payments.  
This backend supports various features required to mimic the core functionalities of Airbnb, ensuring a secure application and a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project Goals

- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.  
- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.  
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.  
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.  
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.  
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimization.

## Technology Stack

- Django: High-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.  
- Django REST Framework: Tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.  
- PostgreSQL: Relational database used for data storage.  
- GraphQL: Enables flexible and efficient data querying.  
- Celery: Handles asynchronous tasks such as notifications or payment processing.  
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.  
- Docker: Provides containerization for consistent development and deployment.  
- CI/CD Pipelines:Automates testing and deployment of code changes.

## Entity Relationships

1. User ↔ Property (Host/Owner Link)  
   - Type: One-to-Many (1:M)  
   - A host can own many properties, but each property belongs to only one host.

2. User ↔ Booking (Guest Link)
   - Type: One-to-Many (1:M)  
   - A user can make multiple bookings.

3. **Property ↔ Booking (Reservation Link)
   - Type: One-to-Many (1:M)  
   - A property can have multiple bookings over time.

4. Property ↔ Amenity (Features Link)
   - Type: Many-to-Many (M:M)  
   - A property can have multiple amenities, and an amenity can belong to many properties.

5. User ↔ Review ↔ Property (Feedback Link)
   - **Type: Two One-to-Many (1:M) Relationships  
   - A review links both a user (reviewer) and a property (reviewed).

##  Feature Breakdown

###  User Management
The User Management  module is the entry point of all workflows in the Airbnb Clone.  
It handles:
- Registration (guest or host)
- Authentication (email/password, Google, or Facebook)
- Role-based access and profile management  

It ensures only verified users can access sensitive features like bookings or property listings.

---

###  Property Management
The Property Management module creates the platform’s supply side — property listings.  
It allows hosts to:
- Create, edit, publish, or deactivate listings  
- Set daily rates and seasonal pricing  
- Configure amenities and rules  

This feature transforms a host’s physical home into a digital, searchable, and bookable product.

## Booking System
Includes:
- Real-time availability checks  
- Booking creation and cancellation  
- Price calculation  
- Concurrency control  

It ensures integrity by preventing double-bookings and provides accurate, consistent pricing.

## API Security

### Authentication & Session Management
Security measures include:
- Password hashing  
- Token-based authentication (JWT)  
- Secure communication (TLS/SSL)

These ensure:
- Protection from data breaches  
- Identity verification without DB lookups  
- Safe transmission of sensitive data


### Authorization & Access Control
Implements:
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Resource-Based Authorization**

Examples:
- Only hosts can create property listings.  
- Only guests can make or cancel bookings.  
- Hosts can edit only their own listings.

This prevents horizontal escalation and ensures privacy and integrity.

### Rate Limiting
Prevents abuse and DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests per user/IP per minute.


### Idempotency
Ensures repeated POST requests (e.g., booking) do not create duplicate entries or charges.



## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD ensures that the backend is tested, validated, and deployed automatically.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
Uses GitHub Actionsto:
- Run tests  
- Build applications  
- Detect syntax or logic errors before deployment  

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Continuous Delivery: Keeps code production-ready.  
- Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploys approved builds.

Automation reduces human error and speeds up delivery cycles for development teams.



## Tools

- GitHub Actions: For automated testing, building, and deployment.  
- Docker: For easy deployment, scalability, and team collaboration.
